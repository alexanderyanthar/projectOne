# projectOne

## Technical challenges: 
- SVGS not loading despite changing fill color. 
- Footer logo not given in the right color. Is there a way to change the color of a png?
- Footer content not lining up perfectly at the bottom. 

## Technical wins: 
- Initial draft of desktop landing page completed in under 24hours.
- Leveraged mixins to keep SCSS short and sweet.  

## To improve:
- Refine details of overall landing page. 
- Create more consistency with font styling. 
- Look over mixins and look for new mixin and/or resuseable code opportunities. 
- Revisit SVGs and bottom of footer alignment issue. 
- Time allowing, create a branch to see how you would go about the project the second time.
